> chatFTW works with the latest OpenAI Node.js SDK version (i.e., `4.20.0` as of the time of writing).

## Description

chatFTW is designed to imitate OpenAI's official ChatGPT, serving as a GUI (i.e., graphical user interface) for tutorials presented on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@codewithrok">Code OpenAI API with Rok</a> YouTube channel. The main focus is on advanced chat functionalities, with no attention given to non-relevant aspects. Therefore, the sidebar is completely removed.

> "FTW" is internet slang for, "For the win!" and is used especially to express approval or support of something. It is often added as enthusiastic emphasis to the end of a comment, message, or post. Sometimes genuine, but often sarcastic (<a href="https://en.amazingtalker.com/questions/638">source</a>).

_PS: OpenAI discourages having a GPT's name end with "GPT" (<a href="https://openai.com/brand">source</a>)._
